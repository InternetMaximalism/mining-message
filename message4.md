Hi, miners. 

After a week of discussions, we have reached a conclusion regarding the application of the unpublished rules. Thank you to all the miners who participated in the discussion, including 0xprv, dc48, Zeus, JohnDoe, and others.

We have decided to withdraw and not apply these rules to activities that occurred prior to their publicationã€€completely. This application not only goes completely against our and the community's values but would also make this game of privacy to a disorganized airdrop. We believe that the process of this discussion and its conclusion were necessary to maintain future rules, implement safe changes, and establish a strong culture where miners and users can trust these processes.
We are withdrawing many of the points written in message3. 

Originally, while the technical purpose of this game is to participate in and maintain a steady number in the anonymity set, in a broader scope, this is about enabling collaboration without negotiation, as seen in many mining systems. Although this game has generated many negotiations this time, we believe these should be minimized going forward. We will work on creating an environment where miners can focus more on the game.

Additionally, due to technical difficulties, we are unable to create an overlapping deposit period between L1 and L2. Layer 1's main contract deposits will stop at 19th UTC 00:00. Regarding this, we will also completely remove penalties for half-way deposits in deposit cycles that began one week prior, to avoid changes in rewards. One week has been stated from the beginning as the reward generation interval and is a sufficiently safe deposit cycle period. Withdrawals can be made at any time.

Specific policies are as follows:

1. Complete cessation of Case 3 application to all activities from and including 10 days before publication
2. Not applying half-way penalties for deposit cycles that began after 12th 0:00
