Hi, miners!

Thanks for staying in the game.

Tomorrow, we move to Base. The mainnet contract will be abandoned a week after the move. Please finish your 10 ETH deposit cycle in this period, and don't start a new cycle. Please make a new cycle on Base.

Another big new is a new functionality of the CLI. In the next version, you can select 1 time deposit not only 10 times. It's good for beginners. But please note that it only makes 3.33% rewards in the rule, so it's not efficient.

## Answers to the community opinions

### part 1
It's a very important moment for us; we ask the admin to copy and post this part 1 in the chat as well.

What made us consistent and restricted our greed is the disclosure of this mining from the beginning and its publishing policy.
The policy had been prioritizing giving enough guidance for ppl to get opportunities and expect something good by contributing to privacy, then we published the mining from the beginning with a full guidance.
So the policy has been all about guidance instead of publishing all the rules. What we expected was that people run the software(CLI) and wait as we do for this protocol. We’ve been just running with a randomized period as it was described in this main github page, while we realized rebooting can make rushy deposits to maximize the volume.

We made the HackMD document as a guide, not a rule book like you described. It described what miners can not do before and after running the CLI since we did not expect any problem in running CLI to follow the rewarding mechanism automatically. Seems that we had a wrong expectation; that’s the reason why we published the rules on 10th October. From the beginning on 6th August, the circulation and the highly distinguishable deposit was prohibited as the rule. 

So this reaction was totally what we did not expect honestly, but what happened happened. The discussion is about how to save the miners who just tried to use the CLI. 

We can not change the structure, we can change the parameter only for this time. Saving rushers should be dealt with by another way, and we should do something for them.

> the challenges i am aware of are the team's inconsistent adaptation of rules, the monopoly of initial mining rewards, and the arbitrary introduction of treasury rewards, which hurt INTMAX's brand. 

The rule structure has been consistent, and we did not expect that non-published rule would make a problem if miners just would run CLI.
We are so grateful to you for caring about this project and its brand. The first priority is achieving the goal of bringing privacy to Ethereum with extreme scalability. The brand is a part of that. We hate branding while we admit it’s important. Branding is too prioritized in this crypto space. If we really prioritize branding and the greedy result of the market, we don’t say privacy. We choose more fancy temporal crypto moves. Anyway, we don’t quit this because of branding or critics, since financial privacy is already hated and always critisized. Why do we quit something just because some people critisize this project?

Yes, “the arbitrary introduction of treasury rewards” was a bad idea. 100%, this was a proposal of “retroactively adapting rules” in your word, since it was newly proposed after mining started unlike the other rule structures. We did not want people to call this “tax”, but it’s bad same as it. Let’s reject it. 

>the monopoly of initial mining rewards

It was not what we intended. Nobody came after we published it from the beginning. Even after we tweeted with a pinned repository, people did not come. Then we made direct messages to invite privacy people, then we got relieved to see people came. We truly appreciate it that you started this. 

To fix this kind of centralisation of funds, we’ll donate large amounts of funds to the Treasury.

>thought that more deposits and withdrawals would lead to more mixing and therefore better privacy. We genuinely believed that more deposits = more privacy = more rewards

Yes, that’s the underlying idea. But there are many ways to destroy this thesis, that’s the reason why there’s circulation prevention in the hackmd guidance and why randomization is in the CLI and this function is clearly stated in this main github page from the beginning.  

>All we did was manually rebooting the program regularly. Why should we be penalized just because we didn’t use it exactly as the team expected?

The problem is not “we didn’t use it exactly as the team expected”, but 10 times out of 10 times, it was used in an unexpected way intentionally. We distributed the software and the guide so as not to mislead the expected reward. 

>Our primary incentive is surely the ITX tokens for economic return. But please understand that we are also excited about the stateless privacy protocol, which still pursues the goal that many other protocols have already abandoned. 

We are happy to have you in this community too, and truly excited to work with you to maintain the privacy of Ethereum.

> A game-theoretically difficult situation

Actually this is the main reason we need to do something for you regarding this incident. We truly understand this point.

Hi, guys.
Anyway the things have just begun. We have 40 days before the next halving. Many hesitated this mining because of gas fee, but it’ll be significantly small on Base. The main stage is coming soon. Stay in the game, don’t miss it.

Let us add part 2 later.
